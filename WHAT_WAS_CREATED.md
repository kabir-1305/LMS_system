## 🎓 Key Concepts Explained

### The Hierarchy
```
ADMIN (Top)
  Creates everything
  Controls everything
  Sees everything
  
  ↓
  
HOD (Department)
  Manages their department
  Oversees teachers
  Monitors students

  Marks attendance
  Grades assignments
  Posts announcements
  
  ↓
  
STUDENT (Individual)
  Views attendance
  Submits work
  Pays fees
```

### The Flow
```
Data flows DOWN (Admin creates, HOD manages, Teacher uses, Student views)
Notifications flow UP (Student action → Teacher alert → HOD sees → Admin reports)
```
